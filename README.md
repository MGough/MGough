I spend most of my time making systems work together, and trying to improve the developer experience & workflow.

### Working with me
- Send me questions whenever you have them! It's not spamming me. I'll get back to you when I can, asynchronous communication is great.
- If I'm pointing out something obvious that you already know it's because someone else might be reading it, or will in the future and might not know that key piece of information.
- Challenge me even if I seem certain or set in my way - It helps all of us improve.

### Ask me about
- Devops, Infra, Deployments
- NestJS, NextJS, Typescript
- Skiing, Climbing, Hiking
